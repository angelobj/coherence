\arguments{
\item{samplingFreq}{Numeric value specifying the sampling frequency of the signals in Hz. Default is 1000 Hz.}

\item{duration}{Numeric value specifying the duration of the signals in seconds. Default is 8 seconds.}

\item{target_freq}{Numeric value specifying the target frequency of the sine wave in Hz. Default is 10 Hz.}

\item{noise_level}{Numeric value specifying the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the second signal. Default is 0.5.}

\item{plot}{Logical indicating whether to generate plots of the signals. Default is TRUE.}

\item{filter_freqs}{Optional numeric value specifying a frequency threshold (in Hz). If provided, only frequency components above this value will be included in the FFT analysis.}

\item{seed}{Integer specifying the random seed for reproducibility. Default is 1.}

\item{out}{Character string specifying the output format:
\item{"data"}{(Default) Returns only the simulated signals as a data frame.}
\item{"all"}{Returns a list containing the simulated signals, FFT analysis, and plots.}}
}
\value{
Depending on the value of `out`:
  \item{data}{A data frame containing the simulated signals (time, signal1, signal2).}
  \item{all}{A list containing:
    \item{signals}{Data frame with the simulated signals}
    \item{fft}{FFT results for both signals}
    \item{plot}{Time and frequency domain plots (if `plot = TRUE`)}
  }

\description{
Simulates two signals: one as a pure sine wave and the other as a noisy version of the sine wave.
Computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of both signals and optionally generates plots of the time and frequency domain representations.
